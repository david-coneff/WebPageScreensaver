"""rhiz — run rhizome's pinned tooling against THIS repository.

The executable tooling (rhiz-lint, rhiz-search, doc-graph) lives in the rhizome
repository and ONLY there. This thin bootstrap resolves a rhizome checkout at the
shared **`tools-stable`** channel and forwards a subcommand to the matching tool
with this repo as its target — so every repo runs the ONE canonical version of
the tools, never a copy that can drift apart. The channel moves only when rhizome
blesses a tool revision (a single fast-forward), so the whole ecosystem advances
together. See `rhiz-child-repo-convention.md` §1.1.

This file is itself a stable bootstrap (like `gradlew`/`mvnw`): copy it into a
child repo's `tools/`. It rarely changes; the tools it dispatches to are never
copied. Keep it current with `rhiz self-update` (pulls the canonical bootstrap
from the channel).

Forge-agnostic. Nothing here hardcodes a host beyond a *default* URL:
  $RHIZ_TOOLS_URL  — where rhizome lives (default: the GitHub origin). Point it at
                     a Forgejo/Gitea/self-hosted instance to switch forges; git,
                     the channel branch, and the tools are otherwise identical.
  $RHIZ_TOOLS_REF  — channel/ref to track (default: tools-stable). A SHA here is
                     the escape-hatch for temporarily pinning during a risky bump.
  $RHIZ_TOOLS_PATH — an existing local rhizome checkout (e.g. a sibling clone);
                     used as-is for dev speed. CI's source of truth is the channel.
  $RHIZ_ROOT       — the TARGET repo, explicitly. Default is the enclosing git
                     toplevel; outside any repo the bootstrap refuses (no cwd
                     fallback) rather than adopt a non-repo directory as a target.

Between the env vars and the defaults sits the repo's committed binding
(`.rhiz-binding.json` at the target repo's root — the durable protocol pin of
protocol-instance-split R6/principle 4): `protocol_url` / `protocol_ref` /
`protocol_path` supply what the env does not, so pointing a repo at a
`rhizome-protocol[-<id>]` fork is a committed config change, not a code change.
Env still wins (session-scoped override beats the committed pin, deliberately —
that is the draft-testing lever of the promotion lifecycle).

Resolution order for the rhizome checkout:
  1. $RHIZ_TOOLS_PATH if it points at a real checkout;
  2. the binding's `protocol_path` if it points at a real checkout;
  3. a cached clone at <repo>/.rhiz-tools/rhizome, fetched to the channel from
     $RHIZ_TOOLS_URL (else the binding's `protocol_url`) at $RHIZ_TOOLS_REF
     (else the binding's `protocol_ref`).

Subcommands — the BOOTSTRAP ones live here, because they must work before (or
without) a channel snapshot. Every other subcommand (lint, search, maintain, work, judge,
bucket-check, …) is forwarded to `tools/rhiz_dispatch.py` IN THE RESOLVED CHECKOUT, so a
copied bootstrap always runs the channel's current table. `rhiz help` prints all of it.
  help             the full subcommand table (this list + the forwarding half's)
  setup            FIRST RUN on a machine: fetch the tools cache, arm this repo's
                   hooks (committable form), link the declared slash-commands, print
                   the preflight verdict + what is live now vs next session.
                   Idempotent. Also `/rhiz-setup`.
  link-commands    Link this repo's DECLARED slash-commands into the user-level dir,
                   so they resolve from a workspace root that is not itself a repo.
                   `--check` reports without touching. `setup` calls this; it is
                   also here for re-linking after the repo moves.
  hook <adapter>   HOOK ENTRYPOINT — what a child's committed .claude/settings.json
                   invokes instead of naming a path inside the gitignored cache.
                   This file is TRACKED, so a fresh clone can always reach it; the
                   cached adapter it forwards to is not (EL-152). Self-heals on
                   SessionStart, announces if it cannot, never fails the session.
  update           refresh the cached rhizome checkout — a NO-OP (warns rather than
                   silently doing nothing) when this root resolves via $RHIZ_TOOLS_PATH,
                   a committed binding, or being the source repo itself; `where` shows
                   which tier is live
  self-update      overwrite this bootstrap with the channel's canonical copy
  channel          print the channel/ref this repo tracks (drift-guard reads this)
  where            print the resolved rhizome checkout path + forge URL + WHICH of the
                   four resolution tiers (env / binding / native / cache) answered

    "env" / "binding" / "native" / "cache"; `detail` is a human-readable note (the env
    var's value, the binding's own `protocol_path`, etc.) for a caller to report.

    THE GAP THIS CLOSES (WH-12 datum, 2026-09-08): `resolve_rhizome`'s own resolution
    ORDER was documented, but nothing said which tier answers for a GIVEN root, and in
    a workspace where every child's `.rhiz-binding.json` carries a `protocol_path`
    pointing at a present local sibling — this fleet's own normal dev layout — every
    `rhiz` invocation resolves via "binding", never "cache", no matter which
    subcommand runs. `rhiz update`/`self-update`/`where` all exited 0 with a
    plausible-looking resolved path on all 12 fleet repos while leaving their vendored
    `.rhiz-tools/rhizome` caches completely untouched; only a direct before/after diff
    of the cache's own git HEAD caught it. `where`/`update` report this tier now so the
    same silent no-op is visible from the command's own output, not just a diff.

    A RELATIVE override/binding path is resolved against `root`'s MAIN WORKTREE
    (retro-4 cycle 2), not `root` verbatim — the same canonicalization
    `tools/rhiz_stream.py`'s `resolve_slug`/`adopt` apply for the identical reason.
    Worktrees are typically created at an arbitrary location relative to the main
    checkout, so a sibling-relative path (`../rhizome-protocol`, the documented form)
    is only meaningful relative to the ONE place the repo's siblings actually live —
    the main checkout — not wherever a linked worktree happens to sit on disk. Without
    this, the identical committed `.rhiz-binding.json`, checked out unchanged into
    every linked worktree, silently resolved to a DIFFERENT tier depending on which
    worktree invoked the tool. `read_binding` itself still reads from `root` verbatim

    WHY THIS EXISTS (EL-152, second half). A child's committed `.claude/settings.json`
    used to name `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.rhiz-tools/rhizome/protocol/hooks/…` directly.
    `.rhiz-tools/` is gitignored, so on a STANDALONE fresh clone that path does not
    exist and `python3` dies with `can't open file` before one line of rhizome code
    runs — which means `announce_missing_cache`, the thing built to report exactly this
    situation, is itself inside the file that is missing and can never fire. The
    original fix was measured on a multi-repo WORKSPACE, whose root settings.json holds
    absolute paths into a real rhizome checkout; there the adapter does run and does
    announce. The standalone clone — one repo, `git clone && claude` — was the layout
    nobody had a live case of, and it was silent.

    So the hook entrypoint has to be a file the clone CARRIES. That is this bootstrap:
    tracked in every governed child, and already the discriminator the announce path
    uses to decide a repo is governed at all.

    Three paths, in cost order:
      cache present  -> exec the adapter. No network, no stdin read, one interpreter
                        start. This is every firing after the first.
      cold, SessionStart -> fetch the cache (~2s), then run the adapter with the
                        payload. The session is governed from its first message, with
                        no operator step at all — EL-152's own "self-healing is better".
      cold, anything else -> exit 0 in silence. SessionStart owns the announcement;
                        nagging on every PostToolUse would be the overloaded-signal
                        mistake in the other direction.

    It NEVER exits non-zero. A hook that fails is worse than one that no-ops: it puts
